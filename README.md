↪  [What is a closed traverse](https://dreamcivil.com/traversing-in-surveying/)
   
   - each station target backsight and foresight station (Direct and Reverse), keep the tripods in place 


### field notebook - station measurement

- You can register each station, ask calcul to check before recording     
- get back and modify previous recorded stations; be careful: record a previous one overwritte it 
- alert is given when gap is out of acceptance  
- Calcul Poly - give you final x, y, z and a 3d display; if it's out of acceptance, you get an alert; you can download coo.csv  file    
- You can change the "Set": initial x, y, z of the first station & angular standard deviation & distance st dev    
- Reset: erase all data   
- A first closed traverse is given in instance when you open; Reset to start your own   
- You can choose the next station to record in the list (station not yet recorded )  
- 1: compensations are made according to gap between theorical polygonal closure and measured one in proportion with each couple of lengths beside their angle   
-  bearing calcul & x et y calculs    
- 2: compensations are made on x & y linear closure
- 3: compensations are made on z  closure   



#### still to do

- assuming no distance measurement over 500 meter, there's no (yet) earth sphericity correction.        
- not yet complete calcul and station details to download.         
- code to be optimized, this is a training attempt, started with only javascript, html, css.
